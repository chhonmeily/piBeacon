Install instructions :

Make sure you have a functional Respberry Pi with RASPBIAN installed.
Login to SSH as root and execute the folowing command :

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razvanstanga/piBeacon/master/install.sh && sh install.sh install

Initially there will be only one usb bluetooth adaptor support.
To have more usb bluetooth adaptors, edit DEVICES in /etc/default/piBeacon and start them.
/etc/init.d/piBeacon.1 start
/etc/init.d/piBeacon.2 start
/etc/init.d/piBeacon.3 start

I recommend the ASUS USB-BT400/Logilink 4.0+EDR as bluetooth adaptors.

Usage :

piBeacons will fetch eddystone-url/eddystone-uid/iBeacon UUID from a backend and advertise them.
You will be able to create/manage/schedule campaigns from the backend (wip) and use unlimited piBeacons.
The piBeacons can be managed from the backend with device name/mac address/device id and used in campaigns.
One Respberry Pi as 4 USB ports so you have 4 beacons on one piBeacon.

Think of a mall using piBeacons on strategic locations and managing all of them from one central backend, creating and scheduling campaigns for both Android/iOS
with eddystone-url/eddystone-uid and iBeacons UUID.

Config :

The backend server URL/interval in seconds to fetch for changes/device name are defined in /etc/default/piBeacon.
