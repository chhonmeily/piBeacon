Install instructions :

Make sure you have a functional Respberry Pi with RASPBIAN installed.
Login to SSH as root and execute the folowing commands :

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razvanstanga/piBeacon/master/install.sh && sh install.sh install

Initially there will be only one usb bluetooth adaptor support.
To have more usb bluetooth adaptors, edit /etc/default/piBeacon and start to advertise URLs.
/etc/init.d/piBeacon.1 start
/etc/init.d/piBeacon.2 start
/etc/init.d/piBeacon.3 start

I recommend the ASUS USB-BT400 as bluetooth adaptor.
